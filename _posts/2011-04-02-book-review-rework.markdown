So I know that this book has been out for awhile, and actually, I have owned this book for awhile.  Actually, if we’re being exact, I’ve owned two copies of this book for quite some time now.  It’s a funny story… ok, so not actually, but anyway – here is why I have two copies of this book.  I ordered the book off <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> when it first hit bookshelves.  However, I wanted to read it so badly and I couldn’t wait until it was shipped to my house, so I picked up a copy at the local <a href="http://www.booksandco.com/" target="_blank">Books and Company</a> store.  I took that copy home, and started to read it.  And, eventually, the copy I had ordered off Amazon.com finally arrived.  Although at that point, life had already moved on and I never did remember to take back the original copy I had picked up at Books and Company.  So, now I have two copies.  And I finally finished reading one of those copies just a couple weeks ago on the plane, and here is the review.  This blog post does have a point – I promise.

<em>Rework</em> is one of the most interesting – and most realistic – business books I have seen in a while.  And it’s one of the more unique business books I have read.  It’s unique because, in all of its simplicity, the authors of this book seem to understand how to start (and run) a business more than most others.

The authors start off with some very basic suggestions on how to start your own business.  But rather than walk you through the step-by-step process for creating everything from business cards to marketing material, they help the reader consider the most important things first.  You don’t have to give up your 9-5 job to start doing something you love.  You can start working on something with a little as an hour a day, and if you’re truly passionate about this interest and it’s more than a hobby, then you will stick with it – oh, and about those business cards – they can wait.  The key is to prioritize your list of tasks and expenses, and focus on the most important things first.

The book continues by discussing how to build your idea into a productive business, when to grow (or not grow) your business, and how to deal with everyday business scenarios like hiring, marketing, and bad press.

If you’re looking for a no-crap book on how to turn your ideas into a sustainable business, then look no further – start by reading <em>Rework</em>.
