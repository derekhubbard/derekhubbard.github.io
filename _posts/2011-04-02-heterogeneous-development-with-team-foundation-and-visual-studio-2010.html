<p>If you are doing any sort of development in a heterogeneous development environment (say with Microsoft .NET and/or Java, Python, Ruby, etc.) and are interested in how you can leverage a single product that can provide a single source control repository as well as a single place for developers to manage their development process, then you may be interested in an upcoming webinar I will be giving on “Heterogeneous Development with Team Foundation and Visual Studio 2010”.&#160; </p>  <p>In this webinar, we’ll take a look at how to use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/team-explorer-everywhere" target="_blank">Team Explorer Everywhere</a>, which is included with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/team-foundation-server" target="_blank">Team Foundation Server 2010</a>.&#160; Team Explorer Everywhere can be integrated into any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software)" target="_blank">Eclipse-based</a> development environment.&#160; Once integrated, users will be able to interact with Team Foundation Server directly from within their Eclipse-based development environment and use Team Foundation Server for both version control and process management.&#160; </p>  <p>The webinar will be April 7th from 12pm-1pm EST.&#160; For more information and to register to attend, check out the <a href="http://www.sds-consulting.com/tfs-training-series-free-heterogeneous-development-team-foundation-and-visual-studio-2010" target="_blank">Strategic Data Systems website</a>.</p>
