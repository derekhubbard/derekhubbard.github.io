I’m in the process of updating my blog template, so if you happen to stumble on this blog and wonder why the styles keep changing, well now you know why.

The blog is hosted by Blogger (I know, I know… but I think Blogger is great as far as the engine goes).  The actual interfaces you use to manage templates, styles, posts, etc. are somewhat limited at best, but there are ways to work smarter when it comes to this stuff… more on that later.

So far, the theme is simple, which is what I’m looking for, but I think it needs something else so expect more changes to come in the near future. I’m looking at adding some Silverlight controls and/or navigation as well as some Twitter info.

Oh yeah, you can also expect some content in the near future as well. I have a couple things in the pipeline, so – stay tuned!
