There are no problems. There are no challenges.

This may sound naive and immature at first, but it's true. There are no problems. And there are no challenges. 

The words *problems* and *challenges* are soft, and somewhat negative. Looking at the events in our daily lives as *problems* and *challenges* comes from a place of fear. When we are afraid of an event - maybe we have an upcoming exam, or an looming presentation at a conference - and we look at these events as *problems* or *challenges* - we generate a lot of angst and anxiety at the same time. 

Instead, we should look at events in our lives as **opportunities**. The word opportunity - defined as "a set of circumstances that makes it *possible* to do something" - is a much stronger, more forward-looking word. And if we look at events and interactions in our daily lives as *opportunities* instead of *problems* or *challenges*, our experience of that event will be markedly different. Although the outcome of the event itself may not change, our *experience* of and response to the event will.

This idea is the premise of the first chapter in a [book titled "Energy Leadership" by Bruce D. Schneider](http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Leadership-Transforming-Your-Workplace/dp/0470186364/). This book, which was a Christmas gift from the management team at [POMIET](http://pomiet.com/), is next up on my reading list for this year and I'm looking forward to diving in more. 

So to wrap up, as Bruce states in the first chapter of his book:

>"Life offers neither problems nor challenges, only opportunities."

With that in mind, I'm off to find my next opportunity.
