Thanks to everyone that checked out my [presentation][sessionLink] on "Agile Retrospectives for High Performing Teams" at [CodeStock 2013][codeStockLink].  Hopefully you walked away with some ideas of new experiments to try with your Agile teams when you get back to work on Monday.  

The slides from my presentation are embedded below.  Feel free to take back to your teams!  And definitely hit me up on Twitter ([@derekhubbard][twitterLink]) if you have some awesome retrospective ideas that work well with your teams and you want to share!
