That's right. The [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) are still awesome. 

Within the last month, I joined a project that is using [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) for the front end of the application, and [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) for a backend API.

I haven't done much with Ember yet, but I have been doing working with Ruby on other other projects, so I don't **completely** feel like a fish out of water. Emphasis on completely.

But after working with .NET for the better part of the last decade, it always feels a little weird when I jump back into the command line and try to get my Ruby on.

##Enter Ruby Koans
Running through the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) has turned out to be a great refresher of the Ruby language.

The Ruby Koans are a collection of exercises to walk you through the intricacies of the Ruby language - syntax, structure, libraries, etc. And because they value testing, all of these exercises are presented as series of tests for you to work through, all the while learning the Ruby syntax. This learning path is what Ruby Koans refers to as the "path to enlightenment".

I've made my way down the "path to enlightenment" with Ruby Koans before - this isn't my first walk around the Ruby Koans block. 

But each time I go through them, I find myself being consistently inspired by one important point.

##Testing is the culture. 
With Ruby Koans, learning happens through the use of tests. Run the tests, examine the error message, and then examine the test. And, often times without you even knowing it, you end up learning something new about the Ruby language that you didn't know before.

When you get started with Ruby Koans, you may interpret the "path to enlightenment" as the process of learning the Ruby language. And maybe that's true. 

But once you've finished walking the path, you might find yourself redefining the "path to enlightenment". Maybe, instead of teaching you the ins and outs of the Ruby language, the "path to enlightenment" is really the process of learning how to test our code - specifically by writing tests first, and then writing the code that makes these tests pass.

The "path to enlightenment" is less about teaching you the syntax of the Ruby language and more about how to be a better developer. This is the broader lesson.

The koans are now maintained by a company named [Neo](http://neo.com/), but were originally created by Joe O'Brien and the late, great [Jim Weirich](https://twitter.com/jimweirich).

RIP Jim.
